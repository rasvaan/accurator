# Accurator #

Accurator is a crowdsourcing framework developed in the context of the [SEALINCMedia project](https://sealincmedia.wordpress.com), allowing users to contribute their expert knowledge to cultural heritage collections. Accurator runs on top of the [Cliopatria triple store](https://github.com/ClioPatria/ClioPatria). Having all data modelled according to the [Linked Data principles](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) and making the system localisable are key design choices in the development of the system.
